<h1>Civilization in Mesopotamia</h1>

<h2>Question 1: Key Characteristics of Early Civilizations</h2>

<p>
The earliest Mesopotamian civilizations, including Sumer, Akkad, and Babylon, shared several defining characteristics that marked them as advanced societies.
</p>

<p>
First, they developed city-states. A city-state was an independent city with its own government and ruler. Cities such as Ur and Babylon became centers of trade, religion, and politics. These cities included walls for protection, temples for worship, marketplaces for trade, and homes built from mud bricks.
</p>

<p>
Second, organized government was central to Mesopotamian life. Kings ruled with authority believed to come from the gods. One of the most famous rulers was King Hammurabi of Babylon. He created Hammurabi’s Code, a written set of 282 laws. This code helped maintain order and showed that even rulers were expected to follow laws.
</p>

<p>
Religion also shaped civilization. Mesopotamians were polytheistic, meaning they believed in many gods. Each city had a patron god, and massive ziggurats (temple towers) were built to honor them. Religion influenced politics, laws, and daily life.
</p>

<p>
Finally, writing (cuneiform) allowed civilization to function more efficiently. It was used to record trade, taxes, laws, and religious texts.
</p>

<h2>Question 2: Geographic Influence</h2>

<p>
Geography played a critical role in the development of Mesopotamia. The Tigris and Euphrates rivers provided fertile soil for farming. Annual floods deposited nutrient-rich silt that improved agriculture.
</p>

<p>
However, flooding was unpredictable and sometimes destructive. To manage this challenge, Mesopotamians developed irrigation systems consisting of canals, levees, and reservoirs. This control over water allowed consistent crop production.
</p>

<p>
The rivers also allowed transportation and trade. Because Mesopotamia lacked natural resources such as stone and wood, trade became necessary. Boats carried goods along rivers and connected cities economically.
</p>

<p>
Without the geographic advantages and challenges of the rivers, Mesopotamian civilization would not have developed the same way.
